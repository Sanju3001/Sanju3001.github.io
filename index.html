  <h4>Welcome to my page :)</h4>

  <p> Hi there! My name is Saj - I'm a web developer currently living and working in the Greater Toronto Area </p>

  <p> I hold a degree in Electrical Engineering from Carleton University and a diploma in Web Development from Lighthouse Labs. I am passionate about all things web-related and enjoy analyzing problems for logical solutions. I am also a <b>strong</b> believer in the continous learning paradigm: the new labour market demands professionals who are continously acquiring new skills and abilities by means of self education. </p>

  <p> When I'm not working I enjoy reading, playing volleyball and travelling to far corners of our planet - I've been to 25 countries and counting! </p>
